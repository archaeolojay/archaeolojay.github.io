I'm an M.A. Candidate in Public History and Digital Humanities at Carleton University. My current research focuses on steamboats on the Ottawa River, from 1830-1920, and their role in the industrialization of the Ottawa River and surrounding area. I aim to return this forgotten history into public memory through the use of aural augmented reality. I am also currently looking for a Summer internship, so if you like my work, please [contact me](/contactme)!

### Research Interests
Archaeology, public history, memory, environmental history, industrialization, augmented reality (aural), soundscapes, museums, interpretation, digital storytelling, and queer and trans history
