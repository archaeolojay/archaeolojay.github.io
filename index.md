I'm an M.A. student in Public History and Digital Humanities at Carleton University. 

My current research focuses on the history of steamboats on the Ottawa River from 1830-1920 and their wider implications on the industrialization of the river and settler-colonialism in the Ottawa Valley. As part of this research, I will examine how sound can be used to reconstruct past landscapes and create affective sensorial history.
