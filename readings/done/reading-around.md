# Reading Around

With the lack of success the past few days (March 14-17), I've been feeling kind of frustrated. I also haven't been convinced that sonification is the best option for what I want to do. So, I decided to go back to a reading that Dr. Graham sent - Tressie McMillan Cottom's [Sleep Around Before You Marry an Argument](https://tressie.substack.com/p/sleep-around-before-you-marry-an). In it, she discusses the importance of reading *around* a subject to get a better feel for it and its complexities. So following that, that's what I've started to do. In doing that, I stumbled onto acoustic ecology.

- "by mixing natural sounds with traditional music Truax, and others like him, are contributing to a growing field of study called acoustic ecology. It's a discipline that analyzes how we interpret, and are affected by, natural and artificial sounds around us." -- could be useful in conjunction with the soundwalk and the interplay of real and constructed environment through the noise backdrop and sonifications.

# [Noise Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_music)
- "Noise music is a genre of music that is characterised by the expressive use of noise within a musical context. This type of music tends to challenge the distinction that is made in conventional musical practices between musical and non-musical sound.[4] Noise music includes a wide range of musical styles and sound-based creative practices that feature noise as a primary aspect."
