# [Noise Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_music)
- "Noise music is a genre of music that is characterised by the expressive use of noise within a musical context. This type of music tends to challenge the distinction that is made in conventional musical practices between musical and non-musical sound.[4] Noise music includes a wide range of musical styles and sound-based creative practices that feature noise as a primary aspect."

# [Intermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermedia)
- an interplay between two art forms or two disciplines

Trans ecology
