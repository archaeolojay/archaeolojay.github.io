3. Performativity theory
4. Sound Art theory - starting to dig into that
5. Embodiment and soundwalks
6. # [Acoustic Ecology](https://web.archive.org/web/20060623010253/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/jf06/indepth/science.asp)

It's a discipline that analyzes how we interpret, and are affected by, natural and artificial sounds around us." -- could be useful in conjunction with the soundwalk and the interplay of real and constructed environment through the noise backdrop and sonifications.

# [Noise Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_music)
- "Noise music is a genre of music that is characterised by the expressive use of noise within a musical context. This type of music tends to challenge the distinction that is made in conventional musical practices between musical and non-musical sound.[4] Noise music includes a wide range of musical styles and sound-based creative practices that feature noise as a primary aspect."
