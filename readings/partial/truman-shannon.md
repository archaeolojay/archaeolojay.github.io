#[Queer sonic cultures: An affective walking-composing project](https://dfmi.dwrl.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Truman-Shannon-Queer-Sonic-Cultures.pdf)

"intersectional concerns of
race, gender, and dis/ability determine what kinds of bodies are allowed to walk where (and in this
case, the where is Brexit-era Britain). This article attempts to navigate the complexity of these
tensions contextualizing a five-day walking research-creation project along St. Cuthbertâ€™s Way that
we called Queer Sonic Cultures. As academics and artists interested in the relationship between walking
and composition, our initial proposition was to become affected as we walked and to create sonic
cultures (songs) using whatever affected us along the way."

"The Academic Liner Notes begin with a brief description of the location of the walk,
contextualized within the tradition of walking and composing in the British landscape, and the use
of sound-based methods and literature to represent such landscapes. In this section we trouble the
whiteness and cis-hetero heritage of walking and art in rural Britain"   --- my use of queer/trans/Black sound theory as troubling the cis-het-whiteness of walking
