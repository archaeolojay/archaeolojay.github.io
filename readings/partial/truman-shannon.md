#[Queer sonic cultures: An affective walking-composing project](https://dfmi.dwrl.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Truman-Shannon-Queer-Sonic-Cultures.pdf)

"intersectional concerns of
race, gender, and dis/ability determine what kinds of bodies are allowed to walk where (and in this
case, the where is Brexit-era Britain). This article attempts to navigate the complexity of these
tensions contextualizing a five-day walking research-creation project along St. Cuthbert’s Way that
we called Queer Sonic Cultures. As academics and artists interested in the relationship between walking
and composition, our initial proposition was to become affected as we walked and to create sonic
cultures (songs) using whatever affected us along the way."

"The Academic Liner Notes begin with a brief description of the location of the walk,
contextualized within the tradition of walking and composing in the British landscape, and the use
of sound-based methods and literature to represent such landscapes. In this section we trouble the
whiteness and cis-hetero heritage of walking and art in rural Britain"   --- my use of queer/trans/Black sound theory as troubling the cis-het-whiteness of walking



## Queer Theory
As queer artists and academics we draw queerly on the body of scholarship known as queer
theory in queering walking, nature and composition. After Eli Clare (2001), we use the term queer in
its “general sense, as odd, quirky, not belonging; and in its specific sense, as referring to lesbian, gay,
bisexual, and transgender identity” (361), to which we would append other non-normative sexual or
gender identities. Queer research can be “any form of research positioned within conceptual
frameworks that highlight the instability of taken-for-granted meanings and resulting power
relations” (Browne and Nash, 2010: 4). We activate queer as both a noun and a verb in our
scholarship. 

## Colonialism
Walking in nature is a big deal in Britain. Britain’s walking heritage includes many ancient trackways,
green lanes, and footpaths (e.g. the Pilgrim’s Way from Winchester and Canterbury) that walkers and
pilgrims continue to use. There is a preponderance of scholastic writing and guidebooks about
walking in the UK. Centuries of literature from Chaucer to Austen to Woolf feature characters
strolling in the landscape or through cities. Numerous authors use walking as a narrative device,
literary theme, or as a method for generating content such as Wordsworth’s romantic strolls in the

Lake District. There are also books about walking as a lost art and books on where to walk as part of
the pervasive stereotyping of Britain’s ‘green and pleasant land.’ Music demonstrates a similar link
between nature and nation. ---- this is good bc my project uses both walking in nature and music - good for discussing colonialism!
